= SCM Push Trigger Jenkins Plugin

The plugin receives notifications about SCM changes from an external source and
delegates to the _Poll SCM_ trigger plugin of a build job. This way the SCM
trigger can decide if a build is necessary and take things like path
restrictions into account and can add parameters like changed branch to the
build.

Currently RabbitMQ is the only supported external source of notifications. 

== Installation

Current Version: *1.1.1*

=== Prerequisits

This plugin needs the
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/RabbitMQ+Consumer+Plugin[RabbitMQ
Consumer Plugin].

Install it first, install this one and then configure a queue with the
`scm-push-trigger` as Application ID.

=== Message Format
You need to send RabbitMQ messages with the following:

*Properties:* 
`app_id: scm-push-trigger`

*Content:*
URL of the Git repo that changed - must be the same URL as the one configured
in the Git section of your Jenkins job

== Usage 

In your job config choose the *RabbitMQ SCM Push Trigger* in the _Build
Triggers_ section of your job config. 

If you want the push trigger to delegate to the *Poll SCM* trigger (which
actually is the reason the plugin was created in the first place) then also
choose the *Poll SCM* trigger but leave the schedule empty and make sure the
checkbox _Use SCM trigger_ is checked (which it is by default).

If you disabe _Use SCM trigger_ then every matching message will trigger the
build directly.

By default the message content is compared to the Git SCM URL to determine if
this job should be triggered (see Message Format). If you want to react on a
different message content you can configure a custom String for matching the
message content in the _Custom match expressions_ text box.

== "Isn't there a RabbitMQ Trigger plugin available?" aka History

Yes. And if it's semantics fit your needs than there is no reason to not use it.

Our usecase was to avoid SCM polling because we use several Jenkins instances
and together with our code review tool these were polling our internal Git
repository server to death. 

So the idea was to use Git commit hooks to somehow notify our Jenkins instances
about a SCM change so they can react to it.

Because of Reasonsâ„¢ we couldn't just call the HTTP endpoints on our Jenkins
servers so we took a stab with the _RabbitMQ consumer plugin_ and the _RabbitMQ
build trigger plugin_. Every Git commit triggers a Git commit hook that places a
message to RabbitMQ which can then be consumed from Jenkins.

It worked well in most cases but there were problems:

* the _RabbitMQ build trigger plugin_ expects messages containing the specific
  build to be triggered and if you have multiple build jobs that should act on a
  change in a single repo you have to configure the commit hook to send multiple
  messages - one for each job - for us a big problem
* It also is just a simple remote build trigger that has no notion of SCMs -
  that is problematic because:
** If you used the _Poll SCM_ trigger before and configured for example path
   restrictions in your Git SCM config this won't work anymore
** If the Git SCM config contained config to trigger a build with the changed
   branch as a parameter this also won't work anymore

This has let us to look for alternatives. As we like the RabbitMQ triggering in
general the idea was to find a way to just notify Jenkins to check the SCM only
when a change actually occured.

This needed two things:

* a message format containing the repository that changed
* a listener that runs all SCM triggers of projects using this repository

So: Welcome SCM Push Trigger.
