<div>
    Listens to messages on a configured RabbitMQ queue and (by default) tries to
    match the content of received messages with all configured Git SCM URLs. If
    a match is found the trigger is run.
    <p/>
    By default if this trigger is run it delegates to the SCM Trigger to allow
    the SCM Plugin to decide if a build should be scheduled. This allow for things
    like path restrictions or parameterized builds to work.
    <p/>
    You can override the matching by specifiying a custom match expression - this
    will disable the matching against the Git SCM URLs.
    <p/>
    You can also disable the delegation to the SCM Trigger. If you do this then every
    successful triggering will directly schedule a build. This breaks things like path
    restrictions and parameterized builds.
